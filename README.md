### Overview
OpenLearningAnalytics is a fully open-sourced ([Creative Commons](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenLearningAnalytics/blob/main/LICENSE) and [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenLearningAnalytics/blob/main/LICENSE-CODE)) data integration and learning analytics architecture and reference implementation built on [Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics/).

This repository contains a set of assets for setting up and walking through a reference implementation of the Open Learning Analytics reference architecture.
The underlying Azure platform services are mature and well documented, but this set of assets utilizing those platform services is very much a work in progress and comes with no warranties nor SLA's, etc.

That being said, this repository provides a great starting point for the development of your modern education data estate. And once you have your starting point, it's a matter of iterating and optimizing as you evolve your design and build out the solution you need.
We look forward to growing this set of assets in conjunction with you - our customers and partners.

### What you need
To setup an environment with OpenLearningAnalytics, you'll need:
* an Azure subscription (if you don't have an Azure subscription, you can set up a [free subscription here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free), or check the [current list of Azure offers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/offer-details/))
* role assignment of "Owner" on the Azure subscription you're using

### Setup
You can setup this fully functional reference architecture (which includes test data sets for basic examples of usage) in 3 steps:
1) Open cloud shell in your azure subscription (use ctrl+click on the button below to open in a new page)\
[![Launch Cloud Shell](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com/bash)
1) Download this repo to your azure clouddrive \
`cd clouddrive`\
`git clone https://github.com/microsoft/OpenLearningAnalytics`
1) Run the setup script like this (substitute "mysuffix" with your preferred suffix, which must be less than 13 characters and can only contain letters and numbers - this will be used as a suffix in the naming of provisioned resources): \
`./OpenLearningAnalytics/setup.sh mysuffix`

(You can refer to this [setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QnRPHK1vXg) for a quick walkthrough of this process)

### Additional setup options
By default, the setup script provisions Azure resources in the East US region, but you can choose other locations as well (eg, westus, northeurope).\
For example:  `./OpenLearningAnalytics/setup.sh mysuffix northeurope`\
For a list of available locations, you can use the command:  `az account list-locations`

You can also choose to have the script create security groups to facilitate the use of role based access control to the data lake.\
If you are running the setup for an environment in which you have Global Admin permissions on the tenant, and you want to have security groups provisioned, you can invoke the setup script like this:\
`./OpenLearningAnalytics/setup.sh mysuffix eastus true`

By default, the provisioned Azure resources are named according to [recommended Azure naming standards](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenLearningAnalytics/wiki/Design-Decisions), however you can directly modify [set_names.sh](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenLearningAnalytics/blob/main/set_names.sh) before running the setup if you want to specify an alternative set of resource names.

### Additional info
