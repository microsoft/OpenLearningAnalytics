# M365 module
This module provides a set of assets for the processing of roster and application usage data received from M365 via Azure Data Share.

Note that the setup of [School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com/) is a prerequisite for being able to receive this type of usage data from your M365 tenant.

Also note the availability of [Insights in Microsoft Teams for Education](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insights-preview-in-microsoft-teams-for-education-leaders-8738d1b1-4e1c-49bd-9e8d-b5292474c347?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) which provides usage analytics available via the Insights app within Teams.

You can find short videos about School Data Sync and the Insights app on the [Microsoft School Data Sync channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA8ZOC7eTfzLlkcFW3imkHg/featured).
